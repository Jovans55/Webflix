Hi,

This project was just a small side project where I pushed myself to create a good-looking website using only regular CSS and to learn a new database, MongoDB. I thought a video streaming/subscription-based streaming service website would be the most fun to try and recreate/put my spin on, and I really enjoyed making this project.

I was able to test my CSS skills and challenge myself to think about how to style, draw out layouts, research interesting techniques, and more.

I also learned MongoDB with just a quick intro, but I challenged myself by only allowing myself to read documentation to figure it out.

Overall, a fun project I will most likely continue to code and use to test out some fun ideas I come up with.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install

npm run dev # to create a developer environment

npm run server # to run the backend database

npm run build # to create a build
```
